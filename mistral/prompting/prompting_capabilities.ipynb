It's often easier to solve complex problems when we decompose them into simpler and small steps and it's easier for us to debug and inspect the model behavior.  In our example, we break down the task into three steps: summarize, generate interesting questions, and write a report. This helps the language to think in each step and generate a more comprehensive final report.\n",
